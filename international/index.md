DRONI offers the opportunity to young people, youth leaders and youth workers from Georgia to participate various international educational activities, within the framework of Youth in Action (2007-2013) and Erasmus+ programme, mainly in countries of European Union and Caucasus region.

Young people have a chance to participate international Youth Exchanges. For youth leaders and youth workers there are Training courses, Partnership Building Activities and Study Visits, all based on methods of non-formal education. The programme covers the food and accommodation expenses during the activity, as well as major part of the travel costs (depending on the distance and fly ticket price).
